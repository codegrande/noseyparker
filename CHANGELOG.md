# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project aspires to eventually use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## Unreleased

### Changes
- The `Telegram Bot Token` rule has been improved to reduce false negatives.


## [v0.12.0](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/releases/v0.12.0) (2023-03-02)

A [prebuilt Docker image](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/pkgs/container/noseyparker/74541424?tag=v0.12.0) for this release is available for x86_64 architectures:
```
docker pull ghcr.io/praetorian-inc/noseyparker:v0.12.0
```

### Additions
- The `scan` command can now be given Git https URLs, GitHub usernames, and GitHub organization names as inputs, and will enumerate, clone, and scan as appropriate ([#14](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/issues/14)).

- Nosey Parker now has rudimentary support for enumerating repositories from GitHub users and organizations ([#15](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/issues/15)).
  The new `github repos list` command uses the GitHub REST API to enumerate repositories belonging to one or more users or organizations.
  An optional GitHub Personal Access Token can be provided via the `NP_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

- Nosey Parker now has an optional `rule_profiling` crate feature that causes performance-related statistics to be collected and reported when scanning.
  This feature imposes some performance cost and is only useful to rule authors, and so is disabled by default.

- Many new rules have been added:

  - Adobe OAuth Client Secret
  - Age Identity (X22519 secret key)
  - Age Recipient (X25519 public key)
  - crates.io API Key
  - DigitalOcean Application Access Token
  - DigitalOcean Personal Access Token
  - DigitalOcean Refresh Token
  - Figma Personal Access Token
  - GitLab Personal Access Token
  - GitLab Pipeline Trigger Token
  - GitLab Runner Registration Token
  - Google OAuth Client Secret (prefixed)
  - New Relic API Service Key
  - New Relic Admin API Key
  - New Relic Insights Insert Key
  - New Relic Insights Query Key
  - New Relic License Key
  - New Relic License Key (non-suffixed)
  - New Relic Pixie API Key
  - New Relic Pixie Deploy Key
  - New Relic REST API Key
  - NPM Access Token (fine-grained)
  - OpenAI API Key
  - Segment Public API Token
  - Shopify Access Token (Custom App)
  - Shopify Access Token (Legacy Private App)
  - Shopify Access Token (Public App)
  - Shopify App Secret
  - Shopify Domain
  - RubyGems API Key
  - Telegram Bot Token

  These rules match token formats that are well-specified fixed-length strings with notable prefixes or suffixes, and so should produce very few false positives.

- Several existing rules were modified to improve signal-to-noise:

  - Azure Connection String
  - Credentials in ODBC Connection String
  - PyPI Upload Token

- The `report` command now offers rudimentary SARIF support ([#4](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/issues/4)).
  Thanks you @Coruscant11!

### Changes
- Several default rules have been revised to improve performance of the matching engine and to produce fewer false positives.
  In particular, several rules previously had avoided using a trailing `\b` anchor after secret content which could include a literal `-` character, due to a matching discrepancy between Hyperscan and Rust's `regex` library.
  These have been revised to use a more complicated but functional anchoring pattern.

- The `JSON Web Token (base64url-encoded)` rule has been changed to only produce a single match group instead of three.

- The `Google Client Secret` rule has been improved to detect additional occurrences and has been renamed to `Google OAuth Client Secret`.

- Blobs are now deduplicated at enumeration time when first enumerating a Git repository, rather than only at scan time. This results in more accurate progress bars.

- When scanning, Git repositories are now opened twice: once at input enumeration time, and once at scanning time.
  This drastically reduces the amount of memory required to scan a large number of Git repositories.

### Fixes
- When scanning, the datastore is now explicitly excluded from filesystem enumeration.
  This ensures that files used internally for Nosey Parker's operation are not inadvertently scanned ([#32](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/issues/32)).


## [v0.11.0](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/releases/v0.11.0) (2022-12-30)

This is the first released version of Nosey Parker.
Its `scan`, `summarize`, and `report` commands are functional.
It is able to scan files, directories, and the complete history of Git repositories at several hundred megabytes per second per core.
It comes with 58 rules.
